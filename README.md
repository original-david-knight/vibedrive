# vibedrive

**Run Claude Code and Codex through a plan until your project is built.**

vibedrive is a CLI that orchestrates AI coding agents against a machine-readable task graph. You give it a spec document. It turns the spec into `vibedrive-plan.yaml`, then runs a loop: pick the next task, have one agent implement it, have another agent peer-review the diff, apply the review feedback, run per-task verification commands, commit — and move on. The loop stops when the plan is done.

Claude Code and Codex both run in their real fullscreen TUIs inside a PTY, so you can watch the work happen. Either agent can play coder or reviewer; pick roles per run.

## Why use it

- **Unattended loops.** The runner picks the next ready task, dispatches it to the agents, stages, verifies, and commits — no babysitting.
- **Two agents, flipped at runtime.** Choose `--coder` and `--reviewer` per run. Defaults: Codex codes, Claude reviews. Flip them, or use the same agent for both.
- **Machine-owned state.** `vibedrive-plan.yaml` is the execution queue. Every task ends by writing back its status, while short phase notes are kept in `.vibedrive/notes/`, so the run is resumable and the plan stays focused.
- **Per-task verification.** Each task declares its own `verify_commands` (build, tests, linters). A task only stays `done` when those commands pass; otherwise it drops back to `in_progress` with a failure note.
- **Replan with memory.** `vibedrive restart` reads the existing plan plus prior task notes and regenerates a fresh plan informed by what the earlier run actually learned.

## Example

From inside the repo you want built:

```bash
vibedrive init DESIGN.md      # scaffold vibedrive.yaml + vibedrive-plan.yaml from your spec
vibedrive run                 # run the loop: codex codes, claude reviews
```

That's the whole flow. The runner walks the plan, dispatches each task, commits each iteration, and stops when there is nothing left to do. Rerunning `vibedrive run` resumes where you left off.

## Requirements

- Go 1.26+ (the version declared in `go.mod` is currently `1.26.0`)
- The `claude` CLI installed and on your `$PATH` ([Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code))
- The `codex` CLI installed and on your `$PATH` for the default scaffolded implementation flow
- A `vibedrive-plan.yaml` file with machine-readable tasks

## Install

```bash
go install ./cmd/vibedrive
```

Or run without installing:

```bash
go run ./cmd/vibedrive <subcommand>
```

## Quick start

From inside the repo you want vibedrive to work on:

```bash
vibedrive init              # writes vibedrive.yaml, resolves top-level regular files as sources by default, then asks the selected bootstrap planner to generate and review vibedrive-plan.yaml
vibedrive init --planner codex   # bootstrap the plan with Codex instead of the default Claude planner
vibedrive init DESIGN.md    # single positional source alias
vibedrive init --source DESIGN.md --source docs/specs
vibedrive init --source DESIGN.md --source docs/specs --print-sources   # preview resolved sources without writing config or plan
vibedrive restart           # replans from prior task notes, then resets vibedrive-plan.yaml to a fresh-run state
vibedrive run    # starts the loop with coder=codex and reviewer=claude
vibedrive run --coder claude --reviewer codex   # flips roles at run time without changing vibedrive-plan.yaml
vibedrive run --coder codex --reviewer codex    # same agent can both code and review
```

Target a different repo without `cd`:

```bash
vibedrive init --workspace /path/to/repo
vibedrive restart --workspace /path/to/repo
vibedrive run  --workspace /path/to/repo
```

Preview what would happen without touching anything:

```bash
vibedrive run --dry-run
vibedrive init --print-sources
vibedrive init --print-sources --source DESIGN.md --source docs/specs
```

`vibedrive init` bootstraps the plan. The generated config points the runner at `vibedrive-plan.yaml`.

## How the loop works

For each iteration:

1. Select the next ready task in `vibedrive-plan.yaml`, with `in_progress` tasks preferred over `todo` tasks and dependencies respected.
2. Start a fresh Claude session when a Claude step needs one.
3. Run every configured step in order. Claude steps share one session for the work item by default, but `fresh_session: true` isolates a Claude step in its own session. Codex steps run non-interactively.
4. Close any Claude sessions that were opened.
5. Re-read the queue state. If the selected item changed state, advance. If not, count a stall and retry.

The runner stops when there is no work left, when `max_iterations` is reached, or when the same item stalls `max_stalled_iterations` times in a row.

The default workflow scaffolded by `vibedrive init` uses `vibedrive-plan.yaml` as the execution queue:

1. Execute the selected task with the current coder while preserving the plan's hard constraints.
2. Ask the current reviewer to review the changes and write a structured review artifact.
3. Run a second coder step that reads the review artifact and fixes any actionable findings.
4. Run the task's configured `verify_commands`, apply the JSON task status to `vibedrive-plan.yaml`, save task notes under `.vibedrive/notes/`, and commit the iteration with an exec step.

During `init`, vibedrive bootstraps the plan in two phases:

1. Write `vibedrive.yaml`.
2. Ask the selected bootstrap planner to read every resolved init source, then generate `vibedrive-plan.yaml`, review it critically, and revise the plan. `vibedrive init` defaults to `--planner claude`, and `--planner codex` switches bootstrap planning to Codex without changing the runtime coder/reviewer defaults used by `run`. You can supply sources with repeatable `--source` flags and still use a single positional source as an alias for one extra entry. When no source is provided, init falls back to all top-level regular files in the workspace directory. `vibedrive init --print-sources` resolves that same deduped, sorted source set in deterministic order and exits before writing config or prompting the planner. The bootstrap prompt keeps testing and cleanup expectations inline with implementation by default, and only asks for standalone tech-debt tasks when planning-time risk triggers apply, such as a new abstraction, risky temporary coupling or workaround, destructive or stateful behavior, or a broad expected implementation surface. Those triggers describe expected breadth and discovered risk, not actual changed-file counts that only exist after execution.

## Subcommands

```
vibedrive run  [-config PATH] [-workspace DIR] [-dry-run] [-coder claude|codex] [-reviewer claude|codex]
vibedrive init [-config PATH] [-workspace DIR] [--source PATH ...] [--planner claude|codex] [--print-sources] [-force] [SOURCE]
vibedrive restart [-config PATH] [-workspace DIR]
vibedrive task finalize --workspace DIR --plan PATH --task TASK_ID --result PATH [--message MSG]
vibedrive help
```

If you omit the subcommand, `vibedrive` behaves like `run`.

When `-workspace` is set, the default config path becomes `<workspace>/vibedrive.yaml` and every relative path in the config resolves against that workspace.

## Config

The runner reads `vibedrive.yaml` by default. `vibedrive init` writes a complete scaffold matching [`vibedrive.example.yaml`](vibedrive.example.yaml). Shortened example:

```yaml
workspace: .
plan_file: vibedrive-plan.yaml
max_iterations: 0
max_stalled_iterations: 2
default_workflow: implement

claude:
  command: claude
  transport: tui
  startup_timeout: 30s
  session_strategy: session_id
  args:
    - --effort
    - max
    - --permission-mode
    - bypassPermissions

codex:
  command: codex
  transport: tui
  startup_timeout: 30s
  args:
    - --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox
    - -c
    - model_reasoning_effort="xhigh"

workflows:
  implement:
    steps:
      - name: execute-task
        type: agent
        actor: coder
        prompt: |
          Execute task {{ .Task.ID }} from {{ .PlanFile }}.
          Title: {{ .Task.Title }}

          Hard constraints to preserve:
          {{- range .Plan.Project.ConstraintFiles }}
          - {{ . }}
          {{- end }}
        required_outputs:
          - "{{ .TaskResultPath }}"

      - name: peer-review
        type: agent
        actor: reviewer
        prompt: |
          Review the current uncommitted changes for task {{ .Task.ID }} from {{ .PlanFile }}.
        required_outputs:
          - "{{ .ReviewPath }}"

      - name: address-peer-review
        type: agent
        actor: coder
        prompt: |
          Read the peer review artifact at {{ .ReviewPath }} for task {{ .Task.ID }} from {{ .PlanFile }}.
        required_outputs:
          - "{{ .TaskResultPath }}"

      - name: finalize-task
        type: exec
        command:
          - "{{ .ExecutablePath }}"
          - task
          - finalize
          - --workspace
          - "{{ .Workspace }}"
          - --plan
          - "{{ .PlanFile }}"
          - --task
          - "{{ .Task.ID }}"
          - --result
          - "{{ .TaskResultPath }}"
          - --message
          - "{{- if .Task.CommitMessage -}}{{ .Task.CommitMessage }}{{- else -}}{{ .Task.Title }}{{- end -}}"
```

### `vibedrive-plan.yaml`

The runner uses a machine-readable task file. The repository ships a complete starter in [`vibedrive-plan.example.yaml`](vibedrive-plan.example.yaml). Minimal example:

```yaml
project:
  name: planet-v1
  objective: Ship Planet v1 end-to-end in this repository.
  source_docs:
    - DESIGN.md
    - TEST_PLAN.md
  constraint_files:
    - DESIGN.md

tasks:
  - id: scaffold
    title: Scaffold the repo and get `go build ./...` green
    workflow: implement
    status: todo
    details: Set up the initial layout and keep the repo buildable after each change.
    context_files:
      - DESIGN.md
    acceptance:
      - `go build ./...` succeeds
      - fast test script exists and runs
      - task notes capture what was learned in this phase and any replanning input for a fresh rerun
    verify_commands:
      - go build ./...
    commit_message: feat: scaffold the repository

  - id: scaffold-checkpoint
    title: Run the first full-suite checkpoint and fix regressions
    workflow: checkpoint
    status: todo
    deps:
      - scaffold
    acceptance:
      - full checkpoint verification is complete
      - task notes capture what was learned in this phase and any replanning input for a fresh rerun
    verify_commands:
      - go test ./...
```

The intended use is:

- `vibedrive-plan.yaml` is machine-owned execution state
- the runner advances by updating task status in `vibedrive-plan.yaml` or task notes in `.vibedrive/notes/`
- each task should end by leaving short notes in `.vibedrive/notes/<task-id>.md` about what it learned in that phase so the plan can be revised and rerun from a fresh environment
- `vibedrive restart` re-reads the current plan, source docs, and prior task note files, then rewrites `vibedrive-plan.yaml` for a fresh rerun with every task back at `todo`
- `vibedrive init` can generate the initial plan from one or more `--source` inputs, the single positional source alias, or the workspace's top-level regular files when you omit sources
- the scaffolded `init` prompt keeps testing and cleanup work inside implementation tasks unless explicit planning-time risk triggers justify a standalone tech-debt follow-up
- those risk triggers are about expected breadth and discovered risk from the source inputs or prior notes, not runtime-observed changed-file counts
- your external planner can still generate both files if you prefer that flow

### Task statuses

| Status         | Meaning                                                                                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `in_progress`  | Partially complete. Ready tasks in this state are selected before `todo` tasks.             |
| `blocked`      | Terminal state for work that cannot continue without an external dependency or decision.     |
| `done`         | Terminal state for completed work.                                                           |
| `manual`       | Terminal state for manual or human-owned work. Supported by the finalizer and custom flows. |

### Top-level fields

| Field                    | Default       | Meaning                                                            |
| ------------------------ | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `workspace`              | `.`                   | Directory Claude, Codex, and exec steps run in. Relative `plan_file` resolves under it. |
| `plan_file`              | `vibedrive-plan.yaml` | Machine-readable task file the runner advances through.            |
| `max_iterations`         | `0`           | Hard cap on iterations. `0` means unlimited.                       |
| `max_stalled_iterations` | `2`           | Abort after this many no-progress iterations on the same item.     |
| `default_workflow`       | unset         | Workflow used when a plan task omits `workflow`.                   |
| `dry_run`                | `false`       | Render prompts and commands without running anything.              |

### `claude` block

| Field              | Default      | Meaning                                                                 |
| ------------------ | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `command`          | `claude`     | Executable to launch.                                                   |
| `args`             | `["--effort", "max", "--permission-mode", "bypassPermissions"]` | Extra CLI flags passed to Claude. If you set custom args without an explicit `--effort`, vibedrive appends `--effort max`. If you do not set a Claude permission flag, vibedrive appends `--permission-mode bypassPermissions` so agent steps do not stop on approval prompts. |
| `transport`        | `tui`        | `tui` drives the fullscreen UI inside a PTY. `print` uses `--print`.   |
| `startup_timeout`  | `30s`        | How long to wait for Claude to become ready before failing.             |
| `session_strategy` | `session_id` | `session_id` starts a new session per item; `continue` resumes.         |

### `codex` block

| Field             | Default                                                                 | Meaning                                                                 |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `command`         | `codex`                                                                 | Executable to launch.                                                   |
| `transport`       | `tui`                                                                   | `tui` drives Codex's native interactive UI inside a PTY. `exec` keeps the non-interactive runner flow. |
| `startup_timeout` | `30s`                                                                   | How long to wait for Codex to become ready in `tui` mode before failing. |
| `args`            | `["--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox", "-c", "model_reasoning_effort=\"xhigh\""]` | Extra CLI flags passed to Codex before the rendered prompt.             |

vibedrive prepends `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` to Codex invocations so the agent never pauses for approval prompts. If you set custom `codex.args` without an explicit `model_reasoning_effort=...` override, vibedrive appends `-c model_reasoning_effort="xhigh"`.

In `tui` mode, Codex runs the same fullscreen terminal UI you get from invoking `codex` yourself, and vibedrive reuses that PTY session across steps for the current item. In `exec` mode, vibedrive enables Codex's JSON event stream internally and renders a filtered terminal view: the runner prints the rendered step instructions first, then agent messages, command names, and file-change summaries stay visible, while command output, raw file reads, and diff bodies are suppressed. If you explicitly include `--json` in `codex.args`, vibedrive leaves the stream untouched.

### Step fields

| Field               | Applies to  | Meaning                                                           |
| ------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`              | all         | Required. Shown in logs.                                          |
| `type`              | all         | `claude` (default), `codex`, `agent`, or `exec`.                  |
| `actor`             | agent       | `coder` or `reviewer`. Resolved at runtime from `--coder` / `--reviewer`, defaulting to `codex` and `claude`. |
| `prompt`            | claude, codex, agent | Go template rendered and sent to the resolved agent.        |
| `command`           | exec        | Argv list to run. Each element is a Go template.                  |
| `working_dir`       | exec        | Defaults to `workspace`. Relative paths resolve from `workspace`. |
| `env`               | exec        | Extra env vars. Values are Go templates.                          |
| `fresh_session`     | agent-backed steps | Run this Claude- or Codex-backed step in a one-off TUI session instead of the shared item session. |
| `timeout`           | all         | Go duration (for example `10m`). No timeout by default.           |
| `continue_on_error` | all         | Log the failure and keep going instead of aborting.               |
| `disabled`          | all         | Skip the step.                                                    |

### Workflow fields

| Field   | Meaning                           |
| ------- | --------------------------------- |
| `steps` | Ordered list of steps to execute. |

### Template data

Prompts, `command`, `working_dir`, and `env` values are rendered with Go's `text/template`. Available fields:

- `{{ .Workspace }}`
- `{{ .PlanFile }}`
- `{{ .ConfigPath }}`
- `{{ .ExecutablePath }}`
- `{{ .Iteration }}`
- `{{ .SessionID }}`
- `{{ .TaskResultPath }}`
- `{{ .ReviewPath }}`
- `{{ .TaskNotesPath }}`
- `{{ .Plan }}` — parsed `vibedrive-plan.yaml`
- `{{ .Task }}` — selected plan task
- `{{ .Now }}` — current time

## Notes & gotchas

- The runner advances when the selected task changes status in `vibedrive-plan.yaml` or notes in `.vibedrive/notes/<task-id>.md`.
- `vibedrive-plan.yaml` is intended to be machine-owned state. The default workflow updates it through `vibedrive task finalize`.
- `vibedrive task finalize` writes task status back into `vibedrive-plan.yaml`, saves task notes to `.vibedrive/notes/<task-id>.md`, runs `verify_commands`, removes transient task artifacts, and commits staged changes when needed. It does not auto-insert follow-up tasks or enforce changed-file-count triggers.
- In the default scaffold, task-result notes are intended to capture what the coder learned in that phase so you can revise the plan and rerun it from a fresh environment.
- `vibedrive task finalize` accepts `done`, `in_progress`, `blocked`, and `manual` task results. The scaffolded prompts only instruct the implementation steps to emit the first three.
- `verify_commands` lets plan tasks declare deterministic checks for the exec finalizer to run before a task can stay `done`.
- If a task result says `done` and a `verify_commands` command fails, the finalizer rewrites the task to `in_progress`, appends a verification-failure note in `.vibedrive/notes/<task-id>.md`, removes the result file, and returns an error without committing.
- `vibedrive task finalize` also removes the default peer-review artifact for the task so it does not get staged into the commit.
- `required_outputs` lets a step declare files it must leave behind. The runner creates parent directories before the step runs and fails the step immediately if the files are still missing afterward.
- The finalizer stages changes with `git add -A` and only creates a commit when something is actually staged.
- Codex steps use native TUI mode by default, so the app now shows the same Codex interface you get from running `codex` directly.
- If you prefer the older non-interactive behavior, set `codex.transport: exec`. In that mode, vibedrive suppresses raw file-read and diff payloads but still shows the rest of Codex's progress.
- `--coder` and `--reviewer` are independent. You can set them to different agents or to the same agent.
- Agent role selection is runtime-only. Use `--coder` and `--reviewer` to override the defaults of coder=`codex` and reviewer=`claude`.
- `vibedrive init` uses the selected bootstrap planner and that planner's configured transport. With the default `--planner claude` and Claude `tui` transport, you can watch plan generation and review live in your terminal. `--planner codex` bootstraps through the configured Codex client instead.
- In TUI mode, YAML multiline prompts are flattened into one submitted message, because real newlines would be interpreted as separate messages by Claude's composer.
- In a fresh workspace, the runner auto-confirms Claude's trust dialog so the loop can start unattended.
- TUI automation detects "Claude is idle" from terminal-title transitions. If a future Claude release changes that behavior, the detector may need updating.
- `type: exec` lets you move deterministic steps (linters, formatters, arbitrary shell) out of Claude when that becomes cleaner.
- Plan string-list fields such as `acceptance`, `verify_commands`, and `context_files` must be YAML lists. Quote list items that contain `:` followed by a space.
